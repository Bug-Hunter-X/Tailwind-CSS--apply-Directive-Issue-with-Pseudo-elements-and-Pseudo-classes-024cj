This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-element (like `::before` or `::after`) or pseudo-class (like `:hover`, `:focus`, etc.). The `@apply` directive only applies the styles of the base class, and won't take into account any styles defined specifically for pseudo-elements or classes. For instance, if you have a class `.my-class::before { content: "Hello!"; }`, using `@apply my-class` on another class will only apply styles from `.my-class` but not the `::before` styles.
