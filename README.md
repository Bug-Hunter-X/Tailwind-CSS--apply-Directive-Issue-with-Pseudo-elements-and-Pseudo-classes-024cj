# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Issue with Pseudo-elements and Pseudo-classes

This repository demonstrates a bug in Tailwind CSS where the `@apply` directive doesn't correctly apply styles defined for pseudo-elements (like `::before` and `::after`) or pseudo-classes (like `:hover`, `:focus`).

## Bug Description

The `@apply` directive in Tailwind CSS is designed to apply the styles from one class to another. However, this doesn't work as expected when the class being applied contains styles specifically for pseudo-elements or pseudo-classes.  This leads to unexpected visual results.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install` if using yarn).
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

You will observe that the expected styles are not applied using @apply directive.

## Solution

The solution is to avoid using `@apply` with classes that contain pseudo-element or pseudo-class selectors.  Instead, define styles for pseudo-elements directly within the class where needed, or apply different classes to target the pseudo-elements.

See `bugSolution.css` for a corrected implementation.
